		<h2>The Basic Face, But Still Great!</h2>
		<p>This version of Emotiguy isn't as expressive as the other variations on this list. But it still has its uses as an
			emoji. It can be used as a reaction image to something idiotic or strange a person has said online. In a joking way:
			of course! For example, the top right image below can be used as a sarcastic response when someone makes a joke they think is
			funny. Overall, this version of Emotiguy isn't bad or good. But it does serve a purpose in this day and age of social media.</p>
