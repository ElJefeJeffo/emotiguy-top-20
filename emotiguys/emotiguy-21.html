		<h2>The Basic Face, But Still Great!</h2>
		<p>This version of Emotiguy isn't as expressive as the other variations on this list, but it still has its uses as an emoji.</p>
		<img src="../img/funny-pokerface1.gif" alt="A yellow humanoid emoji falling backwards" class="all-images">
		<p>It can be used as a reaction image to something idiotic or strange a person has said online. In a joking way of course!</p>
		<img src="../img/funny-pokerface2.gif " alt="A yellow humanoid emoji walking" class="all-images">
		<p>Overall, this version of Emotiguy isn't bad or good. But it does serve a purpose in this day and age of the world wide web.</p>
