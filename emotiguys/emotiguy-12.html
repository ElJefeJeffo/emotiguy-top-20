        <h2>Emotiguy Is On The Case!</h2>
        <p>Here we have Emotiguy with another nice costume on. As I said in the beginning, Emotiguy has no shortage of situations he can be in; that goes for funny costumes too! There is no use I can think of for this image... I think it's just a hilarious image that deserves the twelfth place. Though, now that I think about it, you could use it in place of the "Emotiguy Thinking" image.</p>
